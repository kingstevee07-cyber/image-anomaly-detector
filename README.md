 Movable – AI-Powered Visual Intelligence Platform

**Movable** is an AI-powered visual anomaly detection platform designed to automatically identify and localize defects in images.
The system focuses exclusively on **anomaly detection**, learning normal visual patterns and highlighting deviations without requiring extensive defect labels.

This project is **individually developed** and conceptually inspired by modern anomaly detection frameworks such as **anomalib**, with an independent implementation and customized visualization workflow.

 🎯 Project Objective

* Detect visual anomalies in images
* Localize defect regions using heatmaps
* Provide confidence-based anomaly scores
* Enable explainable and interpretable inspection results

---

 🧠 Anomaly Detection Module (Anomalib-Style)

Movable follows the **core principles of anomalib-based anomaly detection**:

* Learns normal feature representations from defect-free images
* Uses deep feature extraction through CNN backbones
* Performs patch-level anomaly analysis
* Generates pixel-wise heatmaps for defect localization
* Computes an overall anomaly score for severity estimation

> 📌 The approach is inspired by anomalib methodologies but is **independently implemented** and adapted for demonstration and applied use cases.
